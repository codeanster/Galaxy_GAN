# Galaxy_GAN

## Goals
This project will attempt to make synthetic images of galaxies that are physically possible as well. To do this, I will start by:
* Create pipeline to download images from NASA (MAY EVEN BE ABLE TO USE JWST DATA <3)
* Train A GAN model
* Make UV-R (can't remember exactly but basically a color plot from the real images and then compare to simulated images.
